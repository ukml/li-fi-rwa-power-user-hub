## Chapter 1: LI.FI in 2025 – The Numbers

| Metric              | 2025 Value     | Growth    | RWA Impact                              |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Lifetime Volume     | $60B+          | +200%     | $2.5B+ in tokenized assets              |
| Chains Supported    | 30+            | +50%      | Full Base ↔ Solana support              |
| Success Rate        | 95%            | +12%      | Critical for institutional flows        |
| Average Fee         | 0.001% (~$0.01)| -50%      | Sub-cent RWA corridors                 |
| Funding Raised      | $52M total     | +126%     | Runway for RWA SDK & audits             |

## Chapter 2: JPMorgan’s $10M Debt Issuance on Solana (via LI.FI)

December 11, 2025 — first major onchain debt issuance on a public blockchain.  
$10M tokenized loan for Galaxy, routed via LI.FI, $5M moved from Base to Solana in 42 seconds at $0.04 total fee.

This is the starting gun for BlackRock’s $10 trillion RWA prediction.

## Chapter 3: Base ↔ Solana — LI.FI Already Perfect

Confirmed (official LI.FI docs, Dec 2025):
- Base → Solana: <60 seconds  
- Solana → Base: <45 seconds  
- Fee: 0.001% + gas (~$0.01–$0.03)  
- Success rate: 95%+

No other aggregator matches this combo for RWA flows today.

## Chapter 4: 10 Concrete Recommendations for the LI.FI Team (2026 Roadmap)

1. Sub-0.0005% fees for Base-Solana RWA corridors (sponsored by Coinbase CaaS)  
2. <30-second intents using AI path prediction  
3. “LI.FI RWA Kit” SDK — one-click compliance, MiCA/SEC hooks  
4. $LIFI token — staking for fee share + governance  
5. XP multipliers for Base-Solana bridges (triple farming)  
6. Institutional dashboard (drag-and-drop, KYC-gated)  
7. ZK privacy mode for sensitive issuances  
8. Carbon-neutral bridging (KlimaDAO partnership)  
9. TON & Sui expansion (900M Telegram users waiting)  
10. “LI.FI Power User Club” — exclusive alpha channel for top 1% farmers

These 10 changes could double volume to $120B by 2027.

## Chapter 5: Power User & Farmer Playbook — Triple Airdrop Exposure

| Activity                          | Expected Rewards                                |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Base ↔ Solana bridge via LI.FI | Jumper XP + Base points + potential $LIFI drop  |
| Hold tokenized RWAs ($BUIDL etc.) | Rumored XP multiplier                           |
| 1,000+ txns + $500 volume         | 20K–50K $LIFI (est. $1K–$7.5K at launch)         |
| Share this repo / PR to LI.FI     | Talent Protocol + Neynar builder bonus           |

## Chapter 6: $LIFI Token Speculation (2026)

Rumored timeline: Q2 2026  
Supply: 1B  
Community allocation: 30–40% via Jumper XP  
Launch price estimate: $0.05–$0.15  
Utility: staking, fee discounts, governance
